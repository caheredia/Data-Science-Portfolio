    "Y∼N(Xβ,σ2)  You're fitting a normal ditribution with the posterior (independent) data. In frequency space linear noise translates into a histogram on the y-axis of a traditional xy plot. That's when priors become important, i.e. How much do I know about the data for sure? Do I know the spread of the data or is that something I'm trying to solve too? For example if you know nothing about the mean or the standard deviation then you should express that in your model. In other words be honest about what you don't know. For random data on a line the mean should be well known, however the noise will not. The random variations in sigma yield probabilities....I'm creating a random parameters that match the histogram of the original data. Then you could divide one histogram by another and determine the probability or percentage of data caputered by the generated histogram with randomized parameters. \n",
