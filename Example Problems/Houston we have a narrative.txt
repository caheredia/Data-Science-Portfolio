always hated hearing from my program officers at the National Science Foundation as I sought feedback for my rejected proposals. They would say, “Why should we care about metamorphosis of holothurian larvae?” I wanted to reach through the phone and slap them. And I would usually, stubbornly, foolishly give them some speech that was really only about the idea of knowledge for knowledge’s sake (“The world needs to know this!”), which just doesn’t answer the question. I was terrible at writing grant proposals. One of the great reliefs I felt in leaving my science career was the idea that I would never, ever again have to hear that dreaded question, “Why should we care?”

The presentation might consist of a couple of graphs (“Here are data showing this AND this . . .”), then a graph that illustrates a contradiction (“BUT if we look at these data we see something very different from what was expected”), leading to the presentation of the new work (“THEREFORE I began gathering the following data . . .”). This version of structuring the flow of information activates the narrative function in the minds of the audience, bringing all the known benefits of better communication. The only catch is that it takes a lot more effort on the part of the speaker. This prospect prompts the question, how important is it to you to be understood correctly? In chapter 10, I tell about two groups of scientists who were willing to put in this kind of time and effort in working with me. The results were great.

“Also, Still, Since”


Our starting point is the Informational ABT (iABT). This is a first version where you don’t worry at all about being concise. Our only interest is to include all the compelling information.


Conversational ABT (cABT) is a much more interesting configuration of the ABT for a couple of reasons. First, it reveals the core argument being made, and second, it provides the chance for “narrative relatability,” which I will explain shortly.


Brian recommends finding some way to shape what you have to say into a form that your audience can relate to. If you’re speaking to a group of golfers about the physics of space flight, see if you can present some of the challenges in terms of the physics of golf. Anything you can insert that they will recognize from their world will make it easier for them to relate to what you have to say.


“character relatability”—


This is powerful and important. But by following the ABT process, it’s also possible to connect through what we can call “narrative relatability.”

cABT: We were looking at one way but realized there’s another way therefore we’re looking at that way.

But when it comes to the length, that’s where you need to have the narrative intuition that is the goal of all of this. That is your only hope for the long term—to be able to just feel how many words you need rather than working toward a set number, because there is no set number.


Methods: Paragraph The Hero’s Journey


Christopher Vogler’s The Writer’s Journey


The Problem Is Content, Not Form


Two Variations of the Paragraph Template: Logline Maker and Story Cycle


For a Hollywood movie, the entire story is usually distilled down to a single sentence or paragraph called a “logline.”


So be careful not to force the Hero’s Journey Model to work for you. And that is my warning about the proximate value of this tool—it may not have any value to you whatsoever in the short term. Don’t try to squash your story into it.


It’s in the long term where the Hero’s Journey Model becomes truly valuable.


So here’s the dilemma that the Logline Maker shows you: the public loves and needs their heroes to be flawed. Oskar Schindler had to overcome his greed in Schindler’s List. Rocky Balboa had to overcome his self-perception as a loser in Rocky. Indiana Jones had to overcome his fear of snakes . . . Over and over, audiences love to see this struggle in their stories.


The Powerfully Flawed Presentation


“The mistake we made was rushing things. Every time we showed up to take samples, we felt we needed to rush them back to the laboratory. But finally one day we ran out of gas at our field site, and while we waited to be rescued we decided to collect a second set of samples an hour later, which was when we finally discovered . . .”


This is the point you want to get to—where you can listen to someone’s story and have the intuition to hear these elements. Just as not all stories are created equal, the same is true of the parts of the story—some parts are far more narratively powerful than others. You just need to be able to spot them.


The “darkest hour” is often the most emotionally powerful moment of a story—that point where it looks like the protagonist is going to fail in his or her effort.


Furthermore, the more detail you can pull out of this stage (“the power of storytelling rests in the specifics”), the more powerful it will be. This is

earlier. The note was “Enough with the telling us about what happened to you—we want to know what happened inside of you.” It’s kind of the same note as “Enough information, we want the emotion.”


At this point I gave him the same note I had given the others about internal monologue. I asked him to stop in his presentation, even turn to the audience, and describe what this all meant to him. Take us back to your childhood—to your fears of a boring life—to how long your struggle had been—and then tell us exactly what you felt at that moment.


Insights like these are the “communications gold” the audience is really seeking. And if you can give it to them authentically, they will make a deal with you—in return they will listen closely over the next few minutes as you delve into the science of how these nanobrushes are formed, why they are valuable, and what patents you have filed for them. And they will be interested because you emotionally aroused them. And even if they don’t totally understand all the science, they will still do their best to listen. ����� ������

Bringing It All Together: Archplot, Positive Results and the ABT


archplot in structure while too often the truth is more miniplot.


If the pain of a single individual is a tragedy, and the pain of a million people is only a statistic, then global warming ends up being a hyperstatistic about the future pain of billions of people. How can an audience possibly connect with that? It’s miniplot.


Audiences cheer on the struggling individual, but from the outset global warming has been presented as a story of the masses, who are simply not very active as a unit, being buffeted around by nature.


There is no simple, closed ending to global warming that can be offered these days. Which makes it pure miniplot—a narrative headed in an unknown direction.

declensionist narratives.


So narrative training is the solution.


There is an important difference between inculcation and failing to advance the narrative. If you have a clear central theme that you’re seeking to convey that you address from five different angles, you have the potential to achieve effective inculcation. But if you have just one point you’re making over and over again the same way, you are failing to advance the narrative. Which is boring. And monotonous. And turns into an “And, And, And” presentation.
