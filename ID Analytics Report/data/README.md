Wrangling exercise data
=======================

We have designed a data wrangling exercise for prospective data scientists. We hope to make this exercise straightforward yet interesting enough to help our candidates demonstrate some of their basic data exploration and programming skills. All of the data is generated randomly using the Python standard library and the [faker module](https://github.com/joke2k/faker). We are using the [json lines](http://jsonlines.org/) file format to package the generated data.
